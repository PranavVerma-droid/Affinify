\section{Abstract}

This project presents the development of an AI-powered platform for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, a critical component in modern drug discovery. The system combines machine learning algorithms with molecular visualization techniques to create an interactive tool that can predict how strongly potential drug compounds will bind to target proteins. The platform features a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit, 3D molecular visualization capabilities, and multiple predictive models including traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence in pharmaceutical research while creating an educational tool that simplifies complex biochemical concepts for students and researchers. Specifically, the project aims to achieve:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction accuracy with $R^2 > 0.7$
    \item Processing speeds under 7 seconds per prediction
\end{itemize}

These goals ensure the platform is suitable for real-time demonstrations and educational purposes.

\section{Introduction and Background}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Drug discovery is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process that traditionally takes 10-15 years and costs billions of dollars. One of the most critical steps in this process is identifying how strongly potential drug molecules (ligands) bind to their target proteins. Current computational methods are either too simplistic or require extensive computational resources, making them inaccessible for educational purposes.

\subsection{Motivation}
The integration of artificial intelligence in drug discovery has revolutionized pharmaceutical research. By developing an interactive platform that demonstrates these concepts, we can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showcase the practical applications of AI in healthcare
    \item Provide hands-on experience with molecular modeling and machine learning
    \item Create an educational tool for understanding protein-drug interactions
    \item Demonstrate the potential of computational biology in solving real-world problems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scientific Relevance}
Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is fundamental to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding disease mechanisms
    \item Designing more effective medications
    \item Reducing side effects through targeted therapy
    \item Accelerating the drug development pipeline
    \item Enabling personalized medicine approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current State of Drug Discovery}
Traditional drug discovery relies heavily on experimental screening of thousands of compounds, which is both time-intensive and costly. Recent advances in computational methods have introduced virtual screening techniques that can significantly reduce the number of compounds that need to be tested experimentally.
