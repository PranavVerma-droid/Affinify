2. **Ligand Data Processing**
   Create a LigandProcessor class in src/data_processing/ligand_processor.py that imports RDKit components including Chem, Descriptors, and AllChem. Implement methods to convert SMILES strings to molecular descriptors, generate molecular fingerprints for chemical similarity analysis, and calculate 3D coordinates for spatial analysis.

### Week 4: Feature Engineering
1. **Molecular Descriptors**

   - Topological descriptors
   - 3D geometric features
   - Interaction fingerprints

2. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
   Create a DataPipeline class in src/data_processing/pipeline.py with methods to preprocess binding data by cleaning and standardizing binding affinity values. Include functionality to create train-test splits while maintaining protein and ligand diversity in both sets. Add feature normalization methods to standardize feature vectors for machine learning models.

## Phase 3: Model Development (Week 5-6)

### Week 5: Basic Models
1. **Traditional ML Models**
   Create a BindingAffinityPredictor class in src/models/traditional_models.py that imports sklearn ensemble RandomForestRegressor, SVM SVR, and XGBoost. Implement the class with an initialization method accepting model_type parameter defaulting to 'rf' for random forest. Add methods for training the model with X_train and y_train parameters, making predictions on X_test data, and evaluating performance by calculating metrics like RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.

2. **Model Training Scripts**
   Create training scripts in scripts/train_models.py with a train_all_models function that loads data, trains Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR models, saves the trained models to disk, and generates comprehensive performance reports with evaluation metrics.

### Week 6: Deep Learning Models
1. **Neural Network Implementation**
   Create a DeepBindingPredictor class in src/models/neural_networks.py that inherits from tf.keras.Model. Include an __init__ method that accepts input_dim parameter and defines the neural network layers. Implement a call method that handles the forward pass through the network layers for making predictions.

2. **3D CNN for Protein-Ligand Complexes**
   Implement a CNN3DPredictor class in src/models/cnn_3d.py with methods to voxelize complex structures by converting 3D protein-ligand data to voxel grids, and build_3d_cnn to create the 3D CNN architecture for processing volumetric molecular data.

## Phase 4: Visualization & Web Interface (Week 7-8)

### Week 7: 3D Molecular Visualization
1. **3D Visualization Module**
   Create a MolecularVisualizer class in src/visualization/molecular_viz.py that imports py3Dmol and plotly.graph_objects for interactive 3D molecular visualization. Implement methods to show protein-ligand complexes, analyze binding site interactions, and create surface views of proteins with highlighted binding pockets.

2. **Interactive Plots**
   Create interactive plotting functions in src/visualization/plots.py including binding_affinity_heatmap for visualizing affinity data across protein families, molecular_property_scatter for plotting chemical properties of compounds, and model_performance_dashboard for comparing different model performances with metrics visualization.

### Week 8: Streamlit Web Application
